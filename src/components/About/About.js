            A Full Stack Developer with a passion for technology and helping
            others. After serving as a paratroop commander in the IDF and
            working as a Restaurant Manager in Herzliya, I discovered my love
            for Full Stack Development. I honed my skills through the Harvard
            University online course and the SvCollege Full Stack Development
            program, and then spent 6 months as an Intern with Abilisense in Tel
            Aviv where I created a working app and a Sudoku game. I am an
            excellent team leader and team player, with experience in
            management, logistics, negotiation, counseling, and customer care.
            Now, Iâ€™m excited to use my skills to help people find study partners
            through my business.
